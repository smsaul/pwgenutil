i'm not going to be responsible for the actual security of your passwords at any point in time.

pwgenutil is a simple python script that gets four random words from the eff's long list of words that provide 77 bits of entropy. run in a terminal to get four words printed to the screen. nothing is saved after execution.

this uses python's built-in random module. the word list must be in the same directory as the script.

variable length is currently not supported unless you personally modify the string formatting.

seriously, if you use this tool to secure anything important, that's entirely on you.
