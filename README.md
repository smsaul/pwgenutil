i'm not going to be responsible for the actual security of your passwords at any point in time.

pwgenutil is a simple python script that gets random words from the eff's long list of words that provide up to 77 bits of entropy. run in a terminal to get words printed to the screen. pass 2 or 3 after the filename for a shorter password. otherwise, you will get 4 words. nothing is saved after execution.

this uses python's built-in random module. the word list must be in the same directory as the script.

seriously, if you use this tool to secure anything important, that's entirely on you.
